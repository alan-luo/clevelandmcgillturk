# Cleveland and McGill Experiment

This is an Amazon MTurk replication of a seminal experiment in Data Visualization, the Cleveland and McGill position-angle experiment. 

You can find a link to the paper [here](http://info.slis.indiana.edu/~katy/S637-S11/cleveland84.pdf). The paper is titled: "Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods."

This is meant as an example usage of the [amturkr](https://github.com/alan-luo/amturkr) library. (Currently, it's using an old version called experimentr. This will be fixed soon.)

For the purposes of this demo, data parsing is disabled, so you don't actually have to fill in each graph in order to proceed.

View the experiment live on [Github Pages](https://alan-luo.github.io/clevelandmcgillturk/). Since Github Pages is static, the system won't actually log any data.
